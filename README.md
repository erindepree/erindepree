## Experience

### Data Science Researcher | Data Science Bootcamp | General Assembly | Jun - Sep 2025
  
### Visiting Associate Professor of Physics | Bates College | 2022 - 2025
Recruited to provide support and ensure course coverage during a period of high faculty turnover
* Mentored new faculty as they adjusted to Bates
* Maintained a welcoming a supportive environments with students
* Taught introductory physics to upper-level elective in quantum mechanics

### Associate Professor of Physics | St. Mary's College of Maryland | 2008 - 2022
Promoted to Associate Professor in 2013, Chair of the physics department 2020 â€“ 2021
* Created a 10 part career program that helps students explore post-college options resulting in an increase of student research participation from 60% to 95%.
* Improved learning environment by developing an in-class inclusion and anti-bullying workshop, dramatically increased graduation rates among underrepresented groups in physics.
* Developed a semester-long computer programming course to solve a range of physics problems using Mathematica which was self-taught
