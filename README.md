## Experience

### Visiting Associate Professor of Physics | Bates College | 2022 - 2025
Supported faculty during high turnover, taught a range of courses from introductory physics to quantum mechanics, and mentored students and new faculty.
* Mentored new faculty as they adjusted to Bates.
* Supported new faculty onboarding and curriculum integration, enhancing departmental cohesion

### Associate Professor of Physics | St. Mary's College of Maryland | 2008 - 2022
Led departmental initiatives, developed courses, and implemented programs to improve student success and research participation.
* Created a 10 part career program that helps students explore post-college options resulting in an increase of student research participation from 60% to 95%.
* Improved learning environment by developing an in-class inclusion and anti-bullying workshop, dramatically increased graduation rates among underrepresented groups in physics.
* Developed a semester-long computer programming course to solve a range of physics problems using Mathematica which was self-taught.
* Mentored about 30 research students resulting in over ten conference presentations

## Certification
### Data Science Bootcamp | General Assembly | Remote | September 2025

## Interests
I enjoy playing board games, learning new things, quilting, painting, and making pottery.  I also enjoy spending time with my cat, Mel. She generally disapproves of most things. But at least she appears to enjoy herself while looking down on others!
